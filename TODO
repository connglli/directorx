FEATURES:
1. intercept more events, e.g.,
   1. ui events: dialog, popupwindow, editor
   2. system events: orientation, gps, ...
   3. webview
2. collect crash information by adding states
3. save dxpk in a binary compressed format
4. in DXPK.load() and DXPK.dump() throw meaningful exception and add semantic checking
5. bundle and minify (uglify)
6. some views in an app are overlapped, which makes a single (x, y) points to multiple views; and some app  intercepts events that passes to its children, which makes the (x, y) points to the parent instead of the child; Calculator is such an app, the CalculatorPadViewPager intercepts the tap event that passes to pad_numeric/pad_operator (page1) and pad_avanced (page2), and if the the tap event occurs on the different page (mCurItem != tapped_item), it returns true to intercept the event and hanldes the event itself

BUGS:
1. dxrec does not respond when record Calculator (does not respond only 
   in the CalculatorActivity, but no in HiddenActivity). Specifically,
   the hook cannot receive anything; to reproduce it:
   1. add 
         `DxLogger.d(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HIT AT " + System.currentTimeMillis())`
      to the hook (i.e., XC_MethodHook#beforeHookedMethod()), right before
      any custom code
   2. install dxrec
   3. Add and open Calculator in VirtualXposed
   4. Play Calculator for many many times
   One will see, at the very start, the above logs appear very quickly; 
   but after sufficient number of operations, the above log does not 
   appear any more
2. when the view hierarchy is too large, the dumped string often is cut
   by logcat (some are not dumped)
