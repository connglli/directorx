FEATURES:
1. intercept more events, e.g.,
   1. ui events: dialog, popupwindow, editor
   2. system events: orientation, gps, ...
   3. webview
2. collect crash information by adding states
3. save dxpk in a binary compressed format
4. in DXPK.load() and DXPK.dump() throw meaningful exception and add semantic checking
5. bundle and minify (uglify)

BUGS:
1. dxrec does not respond when record Calculator (does not respond only 
   in the CalculatorActivity, but no in HiddenActivity). Specifically,
   the hook cannot receive anything; to reproduce it:
   1. add 
         `DxLogger.d(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HIT AT " + System.currentTimeMillis())`
      to the hook (i.e., XC_MethodHook#beforeHookedMethod()), right before
      any custom code
   2. install dxrec
   3. Add and open Calculator in VirtualXposed
   4. Play Calculator for many many times
   One will see, at the very start, the above logs appear very quickly; 
   but after sufficient number of operations, the above log does not 
   appear any more
2. when the view hierarchy is too large, the dumped string often is cut
   by logcat (some are not dumped)
