FEATURES:
1. intercept more events, e.g.,
   1. ui events: dialog, popupwindow, editor
   2. system events: orientation, gps, ...
   3. webview
2. collect crash information by adding states
3. save dxpk in a binary compressed format
4. in DXPK.load() and DXPK.dump() throw meaningful exception and add semantic checking
5. bundle and minify (uglify)
6. detect text using OCR, and add as a ocr-text attribute to each leaf view
7. consider rotation, scale, elevation in coordinate of view
8. segment similarity: (1) word bag (2) background
9. findViewByXY should not return the first, but (1) the first with text (2) if not 1, then first with desc, (3) the first

BUGS:
1. dxrec does not respond when record Calculator (does not respond only 
   in the CalculatorActivity, but no in HiddenActivity). Specifically,
   the hook cannot receive anything; to reproduce it:
   1. add 
         `DxLogger.d(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HIT AT " + System.currentTimeMillis())`
      to the hook (i.e., XC_MethodHook#beforeHookedMethod()), right before
      any custom code
   2. install dxrec
   3. Add and open Calculator in VirtualXposed
   4. Play Calculator for many many times
   One will see, at the very start, the above logs appear very quickly; 
   but after sufficient number of operations, the above log does not 
   appear any more
***3. some views in an app are overlapped, which makes a single (x, y) points 
      to multiple views;  and some app intercepts events that passes to its 
      children, which makes the (x, y) points to the parent instead of the 
      child; Calculator is such an app, the CalculatorPadViewPager intercepts 
      the tap event that passes to pad_numeric/pad_operator (page1) and 
      pad_avanced (page2), and if the the tap event occurs on the different 
      page (mCurItem != tapped_item), it returns true to intercept the event 
      and hanldes the event itself
****4. logs of logcat are often lost when the log is too large (even though 
       we've already pre-truncated the log before logging), this makes the dump
       incomplete and incorrect
       + current partially fixed by gzip the view hierarchy then encode as base64,
         but it can still fails when the output is large enough
