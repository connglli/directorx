FEATURES:
***1. intercept more events, e.g.,
      1. ui events: popupwindow, ...
      2. system events: orientation, gps, ...
      3. webview
2. collect crash information by adding states
3. save dxpk in a binary compressed format (consider using the binary 
   and bb64 deno 3rd party lib)
4. in DXPK.load() and DXPK.dump() throw meaningful exception and add 
   semantic checking
5. bundle and minify (uglify) (don't use `deno bundle`, use webpack, 
   parcel, rollup, etc. instead)
6. detect text using OCR, and add as a ocr-text attribute to each 
   leaf view
7. consider rotation, scale, elevation in coordinate of view
10. support multi-window (activity decor thereby cannot be installed 
    only by a width and height, Views.isVisibleToUser() cannot determine
    only by the dev width and height), maybe a DxWindow or ViewPort
    should be introduced
****12. support spaces and uncontinuous editing in text event
****13. support text event in non-activity owner
****14. support top activity to return non-activity
15. add --specific option to allow custom patterns
16. adaptively choose player according to dev information (api version,
resolution, density, orientation, etc.)
17. introduce type information when segmentation, which will preserve
the block to the most extend (but affects uiautomator, 'cause there're
no type information)


BUGS:
1. dxrec does not respond when record Calculator (does not respond only 
   in the CalculatorActivity, but no in HiddenActivity). Specifically,
   the hook cannot receive anything; to reproduce it:
   1. add 
         `DxLogger.d(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HIT AT " + System.currentTimeMillis())`
      to the hook (i.e., XC_MethodHook#beforeHookedMethod()), right before
      any custom code
   2. install dxrec
   3. Add and open Calculator in VirtualXposed
   4. Play Calculator for many many times
   One will see, at the very start, the above logs appear very quickly; 
   but after sufficient number of operations, the above log does not 
   appear any more
***7. some apps (e.g., MS Word) start other apps, and this makes the 
       package name of the activity different from that of the app, and
       task name different
8. yota info commands may fail on real devices
****9. dumpsys activity can only dump activity, but not dialogs, popupwindow, ...
10. In TabHost pattern is not strictly a Tab name, then how to resolve the tab 
    name where v resides? Maybe we can do something when recording?
